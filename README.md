This is a text adventure game where you wake up in a pit and don't remember anything. If you choose to do so, you can walk into a dungeon, where there are
giant rats, deadly pits, skeletons and loads of treasure. Fight your way through the dungeon and either end up in the treasure room or walk willingly to your death.
